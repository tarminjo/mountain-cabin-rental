# Mountain Cabin Rental Platform

Mountain Cabin Rental Platform is a full-stack web application designed for renting mountain cabins across Serbia. The system supports three user roles: tourists, cabin owners, and administrators. Tourists can browse and book cabins, leave reviews, and manage reservations. Cabin owners can manage their listings, respond to bookings, and view reservation statistics. Administrators handle user registrations, moderate listings, and monitor system activity.

The application features secure login, profile management, filtering/searching cabins, reservation scheduling, comment and rating system, and admin tools for user and content management.

The system is built using:
- **Frontend**: Angular
- **Backend**: Spring Boot
- **Database**: MySQL

This project was developed as part of the Internet Application Programming course at the School of Electrical Engineering, University of Belgrade.
